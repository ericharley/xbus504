    "# Nonparametric Statistics: Sign Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical tests require that your data follow a [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). Sometimes this is not the case. In some instances it is possible to [transform the data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)) to make them follow a Normal distribution; in others this is not possible or the sample size might be so small that it is difficult to ascertain whether or not the data a normally distributed. In such cases it is necessary to use a statistical test that does not require the data to follow a particular distribution. Such a test is called a [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics) or _distribution free test_. The [Sign Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_test) is an example of one of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign test is used to test the null hypothesis that the median of a distribution is equal to some value. It can be used in place of a one-sample $t$-test, or a paired $t$-test when the assumption of normality of the underlying population cannot be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign test requires only that the observations in a pair be ordered. In some cases, the observations for all subjects can be assigned a rank value $(1, 2, 3, \\dots)$. If the observations can be ranked, and each observation in a pair is a random sample from a symmetric distribution, then the [Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test) is appropriate. The Wilcoxon test will generally have greater power to detect differences than the sign test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Nonparametric tests often seem so convenient that researchers sometimes reduce interval data to rank order or categorical data just so that they can use the nonparametric methods. Thoughtful researchers resist unnecessary reduction in the level of measurement of their variables since reduction of levels of measurement results in **significant loss of statistical power**."

    "* Observations are assumed to be independent of each other.\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations in a sample of size $n$ are $x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n$ (these observations could be paired differences); the null hypothesis is that the population median is equal to some value $M$. Suppose that $r^+$ of the observations are greater than $M$ and $r^−$ are smaller than $M$ (in the case where the sign test is being used in place of a paired $t$-test, $M$ would be zero). Values of $x$ which are exactly equal to $M$ are ignored; the sum $r^+ + r^−$ may therefore be less than $n$ -- we will denote it by $n^\\prime$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our competing hypotheses then are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $H_0$: The median is M\n",
    "* $H_1$: The median is not M\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis $H_0$ we would expect half the $x$'s to be above the median and half\n",
    "below. Therefore, under the null hypothesis both $r^+$ and $r^−$ follow a [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) with $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $n = n^\\prime$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose $r = \\max(r^−, r^+)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use tables of the Binomial distribution to find the probability of observing a value of $r$ or higher assuming $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $n = n^\\prime$. If the test is one-sided, this is your $p$-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If the test is a two-sided test, double the probabililty obtained in (2) to obtain the $p$-value."

    "\n",
    "For a one-sided alternative $H_1$,\n",
    "* the left-tail value is computed by $P(X \\leq r) = \\sum_{k=0}^{r} P(X = k)$, which is the p-value for the alternative $H_1: p < 0.50$.\n",
